Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n## Linked Data Crawl 2014\r\nWe experimented with the [Linked Data Crawl](http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/lodcloud/2014/ISWC-RDB/#toc0) generated in 2014 by Schmachtenberg et al. ([ISWC 2014  publication](http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/lehrstuehle/ki/pub/SchmachtenbergBizerPaulheim-AdoptionOfLinkedDataBestPractices.pdf)).\r\n\r\n### Contexts in N-Quads\r\n\r\n### Quality of N-Quads\r\n\r\n### Predicates\r\nBy looking at the set of different predicates in the links, we classified them depending on their purpose. We identified quadruples that:\r\n(Data set level)\r\n* provide metadata about a data set or a vocabulary\r\n(Schema level)\r\n* define a vocabulary term (property or class)\r\n* map vocabulary terms\r\n(Entity level)\r\n* classify an entity\r\n* connect two identical entities\r\n* connect two similar entities\r\n* connect two related two entities, either with a domain-specific relationship (e.\\,g.\\texttt{foaf:knows}), or a more general relationship (e.\\,g.\\ \\texttt{rdfs:seeAlso})\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
